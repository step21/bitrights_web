neu: "Neu Venture Capital is an early stage investor based out of New York City. We like to be the first\n\
money into a company. We both lead and follow into investment rounds and can help syndicate. We like\n\
to be involved with our companies, sometimes accepting seats on the board, but always available to help.\n\n\
We are small, but we think big. We like ambitious companies in big markets with founders who can't\n\
help but try to change the world.",
people: "Jerry Neumann is a veteran venture investor, investing in internet startups for the past\n\
seventeen years from his home base in New York City. He has sat on the boards of Lucky Sort, Magnetic,\n\
Pinch Media, PlaceIQ, Simple, Tuition.io, and Yieldbot. He is an advisor to BigML, Ginzametrics, Luma\n\
Partners, and Sociocast. He teaches entrepreneurship at Columbia University's engineering school.\n\n\
Jerry grew up in NJ and went to Columbia for his bachelor's and master's in electrical engineering.\n\
His first job was as an engineer at IBM, where he designed a very small part of the CP microcode\n\
execution engine for the S/390 series of mainframes. He left to get his master's in business from NYU.\n\n\
After school he went to work for Deloitte & Touche Consulting, ending up in their Restructuring\n\
Services Group. He joined Prodigy Services in 1995, and was part of the senior management team that\n\
successfully transformed Prodigy from a walled garden online service to an internet-centric ISP and portal.\n\n\
Jerry left Prodigy to run Omnicom Group's internet division/corporate venture capital arm, Communicade.\n\
Communicade seed funded the best early interactive agencies, including Razorfish, Agency.com,\n\
Organic Interactive, Red Sky, and others.\n\n\
In 2001, Jerry formed Seneca Investments and acquired the Communicade portfolio from Omnicom. Seneca\n\
rode out the downturn and emerged with several great companies, including the newly privatized Agency.com\n\
and Organic (later acquired by Omnicom), Taleo (IPOd), Oyster Interactive (acquired by FramFab),\n\
Healthology (acquired by iVillage), eMedicine (acquired by WebMD), and Domain (acquired by Melbourne IT).\n\n\
Jerry then co-founded Root Markets, and helped pioneer the idea of applying the techniques and tools\n\
of financial markets to marketing services. Backed by First Round Capital, the Chicago Board of Trade,\n\
and other top-notch investors, but way ahead of its time, Root did not survive the collapse of the\n\
mortgage markets. Jerry started Neu Venture Capital in 2008.\n\n\
Jerry lives in Hoboken, NJ with his three kids, his partner Noelle, and her two kids. As such, he is\n\
desperately looking to fund a technology that will create another bedroom in his apartment.\n\n\
When he's not working or with his loved ones he likes to be outdoors, skiing, kayaking, backpacking, or\n\
rock climbing, depending on the weather.",
thesis: "Neu believes that real value is created when a company makes life better for its customers.\n\
We like to support companies using high technology to create systemic change. Companies we have\n\
invested in use real-time interaction, big data, machine learning, data visualization, and mobile\n\
technologies to radically modernize the advertising, media, retail, education, and finance sectors.",
